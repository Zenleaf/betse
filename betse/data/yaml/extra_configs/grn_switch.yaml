# GENE REGULATORY NETWORK DEFINITION
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Mini-simulations of biochemical substances that can electrodiffuse across cell membranes, between cells via GJ, or
# in the environment. Also can be produced/consumed in the cytoplasm, act as gating ligand for a specific channel,
# be actively pumped in or out of cells, changed at the boundary, or plotted/animated at the end of the simulation.
