# The BETSE glycolysis metabolism configuration file, which takes a detailed view of glycolysis.
# Levels and rates described by this model should be consistent with red blood cells (erythrocytes)
# All metabolism related config files must contain biomolecules with the name 'ATP', 'ADP', and 'Pi',
# otherwise, the level of complexity/detail can be high or low.
# Runing this metabolism simulation requires an ion profile with H+ ions defined.

# A Note on YAML
# ----------
# This file is formatted according to the YAML ([Y]AML [A]in't [M]arkup
# [L]anguage) standard. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format
# useful for configuration files -- like this one. For details, please see
