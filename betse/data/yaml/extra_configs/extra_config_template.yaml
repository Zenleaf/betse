# The BETSE lumped glycolysis metabolism configuration file, which takes a medium-course view of cell metabolism by
# considering glycolysis as a single reaction that is regulated by activators (AMP) and inhibitors (ATP). It includes
# models of glucose transporters, including GLUT4, which is activated by extracellular insulin.
# All metabolism related config files must contain biomolecules with the name 'ATP', 'ADP', and 'Pi',
# otherwise, the level of complexity/detail can be high or low.

# A Note on YAML
# ----------
# This file is formatted according to the YAML ([Y]AML [A]in't [M]arkup
# [L]anguage) standard. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format
# useful for configuration files -- like this one. For details, please see
