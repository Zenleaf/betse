# GENE REGULATORY NETWORK DEFINITION
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Mini-simulations of biochemical substances that can electrodiffuse across cell membranes, between cells via GJ, or
# in the environment. Also can be produced/consumed in the cytoplasm, act as gating ligand for a specific channel,
# be actively pumped in or out of cells, changed at the boundary, or plotted/animated at the end of the simulation.

biomolecules:  # specify the properties of any number of auxillary chemicals

  # example of a biomolecule as gating ligand that depolarizes the membranes

  - name: 'Activator'    # give the substance a unique identifier of your choice.

    Dm: 1.0e-18          #  membrane diffusion coefficient [m2/s]
