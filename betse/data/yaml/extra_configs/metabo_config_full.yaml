# The BETSE full metabolism configuration file, which combines glycolysis and oxydative phorphorylation.
# All metabolism related config files must contain biomolecules with the name 'ATP', 'ADP', and 'Pi',
# otherwise, the level of complexity/detail can be high or low.
# Runing this metabolism simulation requires an ion profile with H+ ions defined.

# A Note on YAML

# This file is formatted according to the YAML ([Y]AML [A]in't [M]arkup
# [L]anguage) standard. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format
