# The BETSE basic metabolism configuration file, which takes a coarse view of cell metabolism, only
# considering the very basic production of ATP in a general reaction and background consumption.
# All metabolism related config files must contain biomolecules with the name 'ATP', 'ADP', and 'Pi',
# otherwise, the level of complexity/detail can be high or low.

# A Note on YAML
# ----------
# This file is formatted according to the YAML ([Y]AML [A]in't [M]arkup
# [L]anguage) standard. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format
