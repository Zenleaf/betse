# Default BETSE simulation configuration file.
#
# The following settings can be changed to customize simulations in BETSE. When
# editing the file, note that it is essential that the line indentations (tabs)
# are maintained in their current order, and that only variable assignments are
# changed. Variable names must not be changed. Comments are prefixed by "#" and
# may be altered.
#
# Note that each BETSE simulation requires an initialization run. The
# initialization is required to ensure that a simulation begins with a system in
# a steady state. Each subsequent simulation depends on an initialization run
# specific to the cell geometry and initialized parameters.
#
# Note: parameters listed under the "INTERNAL USE ONLY" section should be
# modified only with care.
#
# Pathnames
# ----------
# For portability, files and directories are configured below as relative rather
# than absolute pathnames (e.g., as "sim_init.betse" rather than
# "/Users/iamawesome/my_sim/sim_init.betse"). Such pathnames are relative to the
# directory containing this file. This allows the directory to be safely moved
# without breaking existing tissue simulations.
#
# A Note on YAML
# ----------
# This file is formatted according to the YAML ([Y]AML [A]in't [M]arkup
# [L]anguage) standard. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format
# useful for configuration files -- like this one. For details, please see
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML.

# WORLD OPTIONS

# will be created in the init and apply to all sims running from the init.

# File sync warning: you can't change any of these 'world options' after running 'betse seed'.

# TISSUE PROFILE DESIGNATION
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tissue profiles are user-defined regions within the cluster to which specific base membrane diffusion profiles,
# interventions, and individualized dynamics (e.g voltage gated channels) can be applied.
# Tissue profiles can be gap-junction connected or separated (isolated) from other tissue profiles.
# Cluster shape and individual tissues can be defined by bitmaps, or specified via various functional regimes.
# When multiple profiles apply to the same cell, options defined by later profiles override options defined by
# earlier profiles.

# A profile's functionality is defined by the value of its "type" key:
#
# -> "type: tissue" associates profiled cells with the same parameters and events.
# -> "type: cut" permanently removes all cells at the begining of a sim run.
#                Cut profiles are ignored unless the cutting event defined below is also enabled.
#
# No File synch issues: Tissue profiles can be altered after the time of the 'betse seed' command.
