def get_object_size(obj: object, divisor: NumericTypes = 1) -> NumericTypes:
    '''
    Recursive in-memory size of the passed object, calculated with the external
    :mod:`pympler` package if importable _or_ raising an exception otherwise.

    This size is formally defined as the sum of:

    * The flat size of this object, defined as either:
      * If the type of this object provides the `__sizeof__()` special method,
        the return value of the :func:`sys.getsizeof` function passed this
        object.
      * Else, the sum of:
        * The basic size of this object, defined as the value of the
          undocumented `__basicsize__` attribute of the type of this object.
          Although undocumented, this appears to be the size of this object when
          **empty** (i.e., when this object contains no elements). For
          garbage-collected objects, this size "...includes the overhead for
          Pythonâ€™s garbage collector (GC) as well as the space needed for
          refcounts (used only in certain Python builds)."
        * The item size of this object, defined as the value of the
          undocumented `__itemsize__` attribute of the type of this object.
          Although undocumented, this size appears to be:
          * If this object is a container, the sum of the sizes of the
            references referring to all objects contained by this object but
            _not_ the sizes of these objects themselves.
          * If this object is _not_ a container, 0.
    * The recursive size of each **referent** (i.e., object referred to by an
      instance variable) of this object, visited recursively up to some finite
      recursion depth. The size of a referent:
      * Visitable only by recursion exceeding this depth is silently ignored.
      * Visited multiple times is incorporated only once. Each subsequent
        visitation of this referent is silently ignored.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This function requires the external :mod:`pympler` package,** an optional
    runtime dependency of this application. As the internal complexity of the
    :mod:`pympler.asizeof` submodule suggests, recursively calculating object
    sizes in a cross-platform and -interpreter portable manner generically
    applicable to _all_ possible objects is highly non-trivial. Since the only
    function defined by the stdlib to calculate object sizes (i.e.,
    :func:`sys.getsizeof`) behaves non-recursively, recursively calculating such
    sizes would effectively require wrapping that low-level function with a
    brute-force depth- or breadth-first search (DFS).

    Doing so would effectively reimplement the majority of the
    :mod:`pympler.asizeof` submodule, a lamentable time waste violating the
    Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle in the best case and a futile failure
    in the worst. To preserve sanity, :mod:`pympler` is imported instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : object
        Object to iterate the variable sizes of.
    divisor: optional[NumericTypes]
        Number (i.e., integer, float) by which to divide the size in bytes of
        each variable of this object, hence converting from sizes in bytes to
        sizes in a larger denomination (e.g., :data:`betse.util.type.ints.KiB`,
        yielding sizes in kibibytes). Defaults to 1, yielding sizes in bytes.

    Returns
    ----------
    int
        Recursive in-memory size of this object in bytes, divided by the passed
        divisor if any.

    Raises
    ----------
    BetseLibException
        If the optional runtime dependency Pympler is unsatisfied.
