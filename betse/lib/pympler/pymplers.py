def get_object_size(obj: object, divisor: NumericTypes = 1) -> NumericTypes:
    '''
    Recursive in-memory size of the passed object, calculated with the external
    :mod:`pympler` package if importable _or_ raising an exception otherwise.

    This size is formally defined as the sum of:

    * The flat size of this object, defined as either:
      * If the type of this object provides the `__sizeof__()` special method,
        the return value of the :func:`sys.getsizeof` function passed this
        object.
      * Else, the sum of:
        * The basic size of this object, defined as the value of the
          undocumented `__basicsize__` attribute of the type of this object.
          Although undocumented, this appears to be the size of this object when
          **empty** (i.e., when this object contains no elements). For
          garbage-collected objects, this size "...includes the overhead for
          Pythonâ€™s garbage collector (GC) as well as the space needed for
          refcounts (used only in certain Python builds)."
        * The item size of this object, defined as the value of the
          undocumented `__itemsize__` attribute of the type of this object.
          Although undocumented, this size appears to be:
          * If this object is a container, the sum of the sizes of the
            references referring to all objects contained by this object but
            _not_ the sizes of these objects themselves.
          * If this object is _not_ a container, 0.
    * The recursive size of each **referent** (i.e., object referred to by an
      instance variable) of this object, visited recursively up to some finite
      recursion depth. The size of a referent:
      * Visitable only by recursion exceeding this depth is silently ignored.
      * Visited multiple times is incorporated only once. Each subsequent
        visitation of this referent is silently ignored.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This function requires the external :mod:`pympler` package,** an optional
    runtime dependency of this application. As the internal complexity of the
    :mod:`pympler.asizeof` submodule suggests, recursively calculating object
    sizes in a cross-platform and -interpreter portable manner generically
    applicable to _all_ possible objects is highly non-trivial. Since the only
    function defined by the stdlib to calculate object sizes (i.e.,
    :func:`sys.getsizeof`) behaves non-recursively, recursively calculating such
    sizes would effectively require wrapping that low-level function with a
    brute-force depth- or breadth-first search (DFS).

    Doing so would effectively reimplement the majority of the
    :mod:`pympler.asizeof` submodule, a lamentable time waste violating the
    Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle in the best case and a futile failure
    in the worst. To preserve sanity, :mod:`pympler` is imported instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : object
        Object to iterate the variable sizes of.
    divisor: optional[NumericTypes]
        Number (i.e., integer, float) by which to divide the size in bytes of
        each variable of this object, hence converting from sizes in bytes to
        sizes in a larger denomination (e.g., :data:`betse.util.type.ints.KiB`,
        yielding sizes in kibibytes). Defaults to 1, yielding sizes in bytes.

    Returns
    ----------
    int
        Recursive in-memory size of this object in bytes, divided by the passed
        divisor if any.

    Raises
    ----------
    BetseLibException
        If the optional runtime dependency Pympler is unsatisfied.

def print_object_vars_custom_size(obj: object) -> None:
    '''
    Print a human-readable tabulation of the total recursive in-memory size in
    mebibytes of the passed object _and_ name and recursive in-memory size in
    mebibytes of each **non-builtin variable** (i.e., variable whose name is
    _not_ both prefixed and suffixed by `__`) bound to this object (_in
    descending order of size_), calculated with the external :mod:`pympler`
    package if importable _or_ raising an exception otherwise.

    Motivation
    ----------
    Although Pympler _does_ define numerous classes and callables for profiling
    arbitrary objects, the resulting output is non-human-readable in the best
    case and ambiguous in the worst case. In either case, such output is mostly
    unusable. For example:

    >>> from betse.lib.pympler import pymplers
    >>> from pympler.asizeof import asizesof  #, Asizer
    >>> class ObjectLessons(object):
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         self.lessons = [
    ...             'Easter Island', 'St. Matthew Island', 'Greenland Norse',]
    ...         self.lesson_count = len(self.lessons)
    >>> object_lessons = ObjectLessons()
    >>> asizesof(object_lessons, stats=2.0)
     592 bytes:  <__main__.ObjectLessons object at 0x7fe937595208>
     592 bytes
       8 byte aligned
       8 byte sizeof(void*)
       1 object given
      10 objects sized
      10 objects seen
       3 recursion depth

       5 profiles:  total (% of grand total), average, and largest flat size:  largest object
       5 class str objects:  320 (54%), 64, 72:  'St. Matthew Island' leng 19!
       1 class dict object:  96 (16%), 96, 96:  {'lesson_count': 3, 'lessons': ['Easte..... Matthew Island', 'Greenland Norse']} leng 0
       1 class list object:  88 (15%), 88, 88:  ['Easter Island', 'St. Matthew Island', 'Greenland Norse'] leng 7!
       1 class __main__.ObjectLessons object:  56 (9%), 56, 56:  <__main__.ObjectLessons object at 0x7fe937595208>
       1 class int object:  32 (5%), 32, 32:  3 leng 1!

    Critically, note that:

    * The total size of the `ObjectLessons.lessons` list is actually 288 bytes
      rather than the significantly smaller 88 bytes reported above.
      Specifically:
      * The flat size of this list is 88 bytes, which Pympler erroneously
        reports to be the total size of this list.
      * The total flat size of all strings contained in this list is 200 bytes.
        Ergo, the total size of this list is 288 bytes -- as verified by
        explictly passing this list to the
        :func:`pympler.asizeof.asizeof` function, which then returns 288.
    * The total size of each variable of the passed `ObjectLessons` instance is
      _not_ reported. Only the total flat size of each type of object
      recursively visitable from this instance is reported, which is useless.

    Until Pympler addresses both concerns, this function profiles the memory
    consumption of arbitrary objects in a human-readable manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : object
        Object to print the variable sizes of.

    Raises
    ----------
    BetseLibException
        If the optional runtime dependency Pympler is unsatisfied.
    Exception
        If any variable of this object is a property whose
        :func:`property`-decorated method raises an exception.
