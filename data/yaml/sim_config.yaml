%YAML 1.1
---
# Default tissue simulation configuration.
#
# You are welcome to change any of the following settings -- except where stated
# otherwise (e.g., under the "INTERNAL USE ONLY" section).
#
# Pathnames
# ----------
# For portability, files and directories are configured below as relative rather
# than absolute pathnames (e.g., as "sim_init.betse" rather than
# "/Users/iamawesome/my_sim/sim_init.betse"). Such pathnames are relative to the
# directory containing this file, allowing such directory to be safely moved
# without breaking existing tissue simulations.
#
# YAML
# ----------
# As the "%YAML"-prefixed line above implies, this file is formatted according
# to the YAML ("[Y]AML [A]in't [M]arkup [L]anguage") standard. YAML is a human-
# readable data serialization format useful for configuration files -- like this
# one. For details, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# INITIALIZATION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configure simulation initialization.
init:

  # Files output by such initialization.
  file:

    # File caching the results of the prior initialization.
    cache: sim_init.betse

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SIMULATION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configure simulation runs.
run:

  # Files output by such runs.
  file:

    # File caching the results of the prior run.
    cache: sim_init.betse

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PLOTS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configure simulation plotting.
plot:

  # Directories output by such plotting.
  dir:

    # Directory saving plotted images and movies.

# INTERNAL USE ONLY
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Avoid editing the following settings, which BETSE strictly requires for its
# internal use only.

# Configuration file version that this file conforms to. For reliable
# comparability, this is stored as a string rather than float scalar.
