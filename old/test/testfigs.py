Demo of the `streamplot` function.

A streamplot, or streamline plot, is used to display 2D vector fields. This
example shows a few features of the stream plot function:

    * Varying the color along a streamline.
    * Varying the density of streamlines.
    * Varying the line width along a stream line.
