BETSE Authors
===========

BETSE is principally authored by [Alexis
Pietak](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexis_Pietak) and [Cecil
Curry](https://gitlab.com/u/leycec) with **much-appreciated contributions**
from (_in chronological order of first merge request_):

* [Douglas Moore](https://gitlab.com/u/dglmoore):
  * [Windows integration](https://gitlab.com/betse/betse/merge_requests/1).

A rousing thanks to these illustrious contributors, without whom BETSE would
only be a dim glimmer in the undocumented shallows of GitLab. **You are
uniformly awesome.** <sup>_As evidenced by this footnote, we really mean
it._</sup>
