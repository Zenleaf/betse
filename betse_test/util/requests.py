'''
Utility functions simplifying access to py.test's built-in `request` fixture.

The official documentation for this fixture is blatantly inadequate. Even were
this documentation adequate, however, this fixture's API is overly obtuse to an
absurd (and almost obfuscatory) degree. This module provides an intelligible
alternative to that API.

    Parameters
    ----------
    request : _pytest.python.FixtureRequest

# All functions accepting a "request" fixture object assume the passed object to
# be of the expected type rather than validating this to be the case. Why?
# Because this type resides in a private module that does *NOT* appear to be
# externally importable: e.g.,
#
#     >>> import _pytest.python.FixtureRequest as req
#     ImportError: cannot import name 'transfer_markers'

    This function returns either:
