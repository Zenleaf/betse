# List of all mandatory or optional dependencies to be installed by the "conda"
# package manager under the full Anaconda distribution.

# ....................{ DEPENDENCIES                       }....................
# Dependencies *MUST* be specified in "conda"- rather than "setuptools"- or
# "pip"-specific format. Hence, the dependencies listed by the top-level
# "setup.py" script *CANNOT* be reused by merely specifying "." here.
#FIXME: Unfortunately, networkx 1.10 is unavailable under Python 3.5 under
#Anaconda. Until networkx 1.12 is both released and made available under
#Anaconda, networkx is currently ignored. Since pydot is ignored without
#networkx, pydot is necessarily ignored as well.

#networkx
#pydot

#FIXME: The following packages are unavailable via default "linux-64" channels.
#Consider grepping about for alternate third-party channels.

#pprofile
#ptpython
